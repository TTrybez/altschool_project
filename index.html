                <h3>Early Life and Dreams</h3>
                <p class="mb-20">
                    I was born and raised in Gboko, a vibrant town in
                    central Nigeria where dreams often seem distant yet
                    within grasp. Since I was a child, my gaze was often
                    drawn to the skies above and the intricate world of
                    technology. I dreamed of becoming a pilot, soaring
                    through the clouds, or mastering the realm of cyber
                    technology.

                <h3>Challenges and Determination</h3>
                <p class="mb-20">
                    Growing up in Gboko wasn't without challenges. Due to
                    some unforeseen crisis which included finances and the
                    untimely demise of my mum, I had to drop out of school
                    temporarily. But despite the setback of loosing my biggest
                    fan and cheerleader i wouldn't bend to defeat. I was
                    curious to fly and this was sparked by the occasional
                    sight of airplanes passing overhead. I spent evenings
                    gazing up at the stars, imagining myself in the cockpit,
                    navigating through the vast expanse of the sky because
                    beyond being my desire, it was my mums as well.

                <h3>Passion for Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    My fascination with technology began with being around
                    my elder brohter whom at the time was a tech trainee I
                    salvaged. I would wake up to seeing him focus on his
                    system all night trying to solve issues for people and
                    that stirred me to admiration. Despite his outdated
                    hardware he always came up with solutions to issues
                    sometimes thought unimaginable.

                <h3>Educational Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    As I progressed through my education, my determination
                    to pursue my passions only grew stronger. I excelled in
                    mathematics and science, laying a solid foundation for
                    my future endeavors. Recognizing my potential, my
                    teachers and mentors encouraged me to explore my
                    interests further.

                <p class="mb-20">
                    Having almost lost hope because of the misfortune of
                    dropping out of my tetiary institution, i was introduced
                    to ALTschool Africa.

                <h3>Alt School Africa</h3>
                <p class="mb-20">
                    At Alt School Africa, I found a nurturing environment
                    where my dual interests in technology and aviation could
                    flourish though one above the other. I chose to study
                    backend engineering, diving deep into the complexities
                    of software architecture and data management with the
                    expectation that the rigorous coursework will challenge
                    me, making me to thrive on the intellectual stimulation
                    and practical applications.

                <p class="mb-20">
                    Outside of my studies, music is a source of solace
                    and inspiration for me. I taught myself to play the
                    guitar and often used music as a means of expressing my
                    emotions and thoughts. Whether strumming chords alone in
                    my room or performing for friends, family and church,
                    music has always been an integral part of my life.

                <h3>Community Impact</h3>
                <p class="mb-20">
                    Beyond my personal pursuits, I possessed a deep-seated
                    desire to make a positive impact on my community. I
                    volunteered my time and skills to teach computer
                    literacy classes at local schools, empowering young
                    minds to embrace the digital age. My innate empathy and
                    willingness to help others earned me respect and
                    admiration from my peers and mentors alike.
